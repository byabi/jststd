<p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for <strong>creating <u>web pages</u></strong> and web applications.</p> <p> Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. <br> With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. <br>It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. <br>HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets.
